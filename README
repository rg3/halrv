== NAME ==

halrv - Command line removable volumes manager using HAL

== SYNOPSIS ==

halrv [operation [device]]

== DESCRIPTION ==

halrv is a simple command line tool to manage removable volumes using
HAL. It aims to be the command line equivalent of many GUI programs that
display a list of removable drives in your computer, allow you to mount
them by clicking on their icon and, later, unmount and eject them (also
called "safe removal").

With halrv, you can list removable volumes, mount a specific device, and
eject a specific device. It does not depend on any GUI libraries.

== OPERATIONS ==

=== help, --help, -h, -? ===

This operation will make the program print a brief list of every
available operation with its corresponding description.

=== ls or no operation ===

When halrv is invoked with no operation, it does the same as if the
operation was "ls". This operation prints a table of removable devices
present in your system, with their corresponding filesystem labels,
UUIDs and mount point if currently mounted.

=== mount ===

The "mount" operation needs an additional argument which must be a
device name, as listed by the "ls" operation. The program will ask HAL
to mount the device in a mount point by label if possible, or by device
name if no filesystem label is present.

=== eject ===

This operation will ask HAL to unmount and eject a device. Its name must
be provided as an additional argument like in the "mount" operation.
