*Question*: When I run halrv, a lot of error messages are printed on
screen and the program does not seem to be working properly. What is the
problem?

Answer: A faulty HAL configuration file for dbus may provoke error
messages about halrv not being able to introspect method signatures.
This has happened in Slackware. Be sure to have a proper HAL dbus
configuration file in place to allow introspection and those messages
will disappear. For Slackware 12.2 users, Robby Workman created a proper
configuration file. It may be available at the following URL:

http://slackware.com/~rworkman/hal.conf.txt

You should back up your /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf and replace its
contents with the above file.
