If you are reading this, it is probably because your distribution or
system does not provide an official package for halrv. If you are lucky,
halrv may provide a way to create a package for it, like a package
creation script.

Supported systems using this method:

* Slackware Linux, running halrv.SlackBuild as root and installing the
  resulting package.

If no official package is available and no package creation tool is
available, you can install halrv using the setup.py script. Normally as
root, you would run:

python setup.py install
