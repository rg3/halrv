If you are reading this, it is probably because your distribution or
system does not provide an official package for halrv. If you are lucky,
halrv may provide a way to create a package for it, like a package
creation script.

Supported systems using this method:

* Slackware Linux, running halrv.SlackBuild as root and installing the
  resulting package.

If no official package is available and no package creation tool is
available, halrv really only needs two files you can copy to /usr/local:

* halrv, the program itself, which should go to /usr/local/bin
* halrv.1, the program manpage, which should go to /usr/local/man/man1

To run, halrv needs Python and dbus-python.

Uninstalling the program is as easy as removing those two files you
would have copied.
